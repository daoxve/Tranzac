# Overview

This is a Personal Expenses Tracker built with [Flutter][1] and [Dart][2].

# Purpose

My mom has this habit of calculating all the expenses she made to know how much she could save at the end of that month.
It was a stressful process for her, and then me because she would end up forwarding more than half of the transactions that she "couldn't finish". 
So, I built this app to manage her expenses from her different bank accounts all in one app.

For now she has to put in all her details into the app manually everytime she makes a purchase(which could be stressful), but i'm working on automating it if possible.

(Probably not since banks have internal security that would just not make that possible)

Anyways... I'm still working on the design. This is a side-project so I won't really be updating it often, so therefore feel free to contribute code, or just ideas/suggestions. (Preferrably code)

So yeah... enjoy!

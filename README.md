# Overview

This is a Personal Expenses Tracker built with [Flutter][1] and [Dart][2].

# Purpose

So my mom has this habit of calculating all the expenses she made to know how much she could save at the end of that month.

It was a stressful process for her, and well... me because she would end up forwarding more than half of the transactions that she "couldn't finish" to me. 🥺

Therefore, I built this app to manage her expenses from her different bank accounts all in one app. 😊

For now she has to put in all her details into the app manually everytime she makes a purchase(which could be stressful), but i'm working on automating it if possible.

(Probably not since banks have internal security that would just not make that possible)🤦‍♂️

Anyways... I'm still working on the design. This is a side-project so I won't really be updating it often, so therefore feel free to contribute code, or just ideas/suggestions. (Preferrably code) 🤲

So yeah... enjoy!
